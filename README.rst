Putsches
===================

Project for a web community to debate and intervene on matters of civic interest.

Putsches is based on the code of Askbot, an open source Q&A system created by
Evgeny Fadeev on the basis of CNPROG and OSQA. In fact, at this point Putsches is 
little more than a Askbot fork configured for Heroku deployment.
